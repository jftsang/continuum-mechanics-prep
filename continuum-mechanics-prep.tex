These notes are meant to be an overview of the mathematical methods and fluid
dynamical ideas that you need to have before taking continuum mechanics courses
in Part III. While not everything here is \textit{central} to every course, you
should at least be familiar with the concepts here.
These notes are not intended to be complete. Please refer to the lecture notes
of the relevant undergraduate courses in the Mathematical Tripos. Appropriate
textbooks are also given in the schedules.
